\## Hey there, I'm Boya Ye! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm diving into the **CRISP project** and creating some cool **Emergency Management Tools** to keep our communities safe and resilient!

ðŸ‘¯ Always on the lookout for exciting opportunities to collaborate on **GIS wizardry**, **data visualization magic**, or any project that blends **technology**, **design**, and a touch of **innovation**.

ðŸ’¬ Got questions? Let's chat about **GIS mapping**, **landscape design**, or how we can use technology to transform the world around us!

ðŸ“« Want to connect? You can find me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyaye/)** â€” let's make something awesome together!

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **She/Her**

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not mapping out the world, I'm exploring it! Nature trails and design projects are my happy place.
